# Construction Machines Images Dataset

### Welcome to use and contibute to this dataset. we highly encourge you to help us building this open source dataset that would help lots of developers and researchers testing their works. Raw and prepocessed imagse data are all welcomedï¼Œ as well as pretrained model. 
## The Goal
The main purpose of this repository is to construct an open source images dataset for construction machines detection. Due to the lack of data in this field, we aim, with the help of all contributer, to develop an intensive dataset that covers all type of construction machines and related objects to be used for research purposes.  As we initiate this repo we have a relatively small dataset of excavators that was downloaded from google images search engine. The dataset consists of 223 image and their related label files in a YOLO format. Despite the low amount of images in this dataset, it still achives a pretty good performance when examined by training a YOLOv4 algorithm. However, This is just the first step towrdas building a comprehensive images dataset that contains as many classes of objects related to construction enviroments as possible. Down below we will list some of the most important calsses that we can start with. To make things easy for other conributers, a work plan will be described below as well. 

## Classes 
1-excavators
2-trucks
3-bulldozers 
4-wheelloaders
5-cranes
